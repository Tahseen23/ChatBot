Data Science ChatBot using Mistral-7B

# Introduction
Data science involves extracting insights and knowledge from data using statistical analysis, machine learning, and computational techniques to solve complex problems and drive decision-making.

# About LLM
For this Chatbot I use mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 using Hugging face API and for embeddings I used sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
which convert every word in 384 vector size and Pinecone for storing embeddings


# Web App
Web App is built on Flask and html/javaScript is taken from Google because i don't like to built website ðŸ˜œ
